# About Me

<img src="https://larrysimingdeng.github.io/dengsiming.jpg" class="floatpic">


Here is **Siming Deng (Larry Deng)**.<br>

I am a graduate student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at **Duke University**.<!-- advised by [Prof. XXX](放教授web，http开头), within [Internet of Everything (IoE) Group](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/).--> Prior to joining Duke, I gained valuable research experiences as a Research Assistant at Shenzhen University under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jun_Zhang93). My work focused on **Nonparametric Statistics**, **Distortion Measurement Error Models**, and **Large Sample Theory**. I developed and analyzed advanced statistical methods, conducted large-scale simulations using R, and applied these techniques to real-world datasets, resulting in four SCI publications.<br>

At the Big Data Institute, I optimized data processing and clustering algorithms. At the Bank of China, I was involved in the deployment and fine tuning of large language models - Qwen 14B. I also utilized the Vue.js framework for front - end development.<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - siming_deng_stat [at] 163.com

## Research Interests

- Bayesian Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Nonparametric Statistics

My current research focuses on addressing critical challenges in measurement error modeling and unobservable variable estimation, particularly in multiplicative distortion frameworks. Through theoretical advancements in calibration methods and simulation optimization, I have contributed to improving the accuracy of correlation coefficient estimation under complex industrial scenarios.
